I am trying to learn the use of MonoRepo through Turborepo and will be updating my Process here. I am building a Chat App, Tech Stacks till now used 
NextJs, Turborepo, NodeJs, TypeScript.

Done with the Setup:- https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/create-new
Had my Packages done with Workspaces:- https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/workspaces

Started by Creating the HTTP server and initializing the Socket Library in the Workspace, so that it can emit and receive the Messages 
Build the Basic Frontend after this, so that I can show the message in the console.

Database Setup and tested, Working Fine



PS- Will be formating this nicely, once the Project gets done
