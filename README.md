# Real-Time Chat Application

## Overview

This is a real-time chat application built using Next.js, TypeScript, Redis, and PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. The application leverages the power of sockets to create a scalable and efficient real-time chat system. The combination of these technologies allows for a seamless and responsive chat experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** The application is built on the Next.js framework, providing a powerful and flexible environment for React-based web applications.

- **TypeScript:** TypeScript is used to bring static typing to the application, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.

- **Redis:** Redis is employed as a key-value store to manage real-time communication between clients through the use of sockets.

- **Sockets:** Sockets play a crucial role in enabling real-time communication between the server and clients. The chat system utilizes sockets to ensure instant message delivery.

- **PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM:** The application uses PostgreSQL as the relational database, and Prisma ORM facilitates database interactions, making it easy to manage and query data.

- **Turbo:** The application is set up with Turbo, utilizing [turbo.build](https://turbo.build) for a faster and more efficient build process. Refer to [Turbo's documentation](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/create-new) for setup details.

- **NPM Workspaces:** The project structure includes NPM workspaces, allowing for better package management and organization. For more information on using NPM workspaces, refer to [NPM documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/workspaces).

## Features

- **Real-Time Chat:** The core functionality of the application is real-time chat, allowing users to exchange messages instantly.

- **Scalability:** The use of sockets and Redis enables the application to scale efficiently, accommodating a growing number of users without compromising performance.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-chat-app.git
   cd your-chat-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables, including database credentials, Redis connection details, etc.

4. **Run Migrations:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. **Start the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application should now be running locally. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to access the chat application.

## Learnings

During the development of this real-time chat application, several key learnings were acquired:

- **Socket Integration:** Understanding how to integrate sockets into the application for real-time communication.

- **Redis Connection:** Learning how to connect sockets to Redis, a crucial step for achieving scalability in a real-time system.

These learnings contribute to the overall knowledge of building scalable and responsive real-time applications.
